Son of the Mask is one of those sequels that simply shouldn't have happened and now after watching I can claim it's a contender for the worst one of the bunch.

But no wait there is more, this isn't just bad it's THAT bad.

It currently sits as the 10th worst movie ever made on IMDB which is an impressive feat. Ontop of that it's the winner of such prestigious awards as Worst Picture, Worst Director, Worst Actor, Most Intrusive Musical Score, Foulest Family Film, Most Painfully Unfunny Comedy and Least "Special" Special Effects.

Starring Jamie Kennedy, Traylor Howard, Alan Cumming and a small role for Kal Penn it tells another story of the infamous Mask and it is beyond belief.

Full of dire cgi, painfully unfunny "comedy", purile writing and legitimately no redeeming features I can't believe that such a brilliant classic comedy like The Mask (1994) could be insulted to this degree with a sequel.

It's just SO cringe inducing! The jokes are too immature even for Saturday morning cartoons. The cartoon violence doesn't translate very well at all and some of it seems distasteful especially for a family film. And for 84 million dollars it looks like warmed up dog poop.

Seriously, everything people say about this film is true. I'm not one to jump aboard bandwagons and hate things because its "Trendy" to, nor do I give 1/10's out often but this is awful!

The Good:

Traylor Howard

The Bad:

Poor cgi

Beyond dumb

Things I Learnt From This Movie:

In movies reducing women down to their bras is funny and comedic, I do it and I get arrested!?

How could a plot including repeated attempts on a babies life not be considered funny? Shocking!

Children being stolen by norse gods isn't even remotely shocking to some parents
